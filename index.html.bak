  <title>Internet of Chemistry Things Education</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>This site is being set up to be an Open Education Resource (OER) portal for chemical education material related to the Internet of Things and Physical Computing.  This site is being developed by Bob Belford, <a href="mailto:rebelford@ualr.edu">rebelford@ualr.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Please note, in 2020 UALR shut down the "legacy server" with eighteen years worth of Bob Belford's  class pages at UALR, and so in the emergency the Chem class links below were added to this site, which my students can use to access their class support material (within the LibreText HyperLibrary). </p>

<p>The IoCT and Python Activities were used in the Fall 2018 IOCT class at UALR and have since been updated and moved to the <strong>IOST Class </strong>link below (<strong>Internet of Science Things</strong>), which is hosted in the LibreText Chemistry HyperLibrary.  That material was originally developed by Ehren Bucholtz and then modified  and expanded upon by Bob Belford, Elena Lisitsyna and Hunter Tiner. The<strong> IOT Class</strong> link below is material developed by Phil Williams in the Engineering LibreText HyperLibrary, and is a completely different resources.  The advantage of using LibreText to post OER over this site is that other schools can easily remix the material into other classes.  So the class material on the links below are more up-to-date, but there is material on this site that is not in either of the two IOT courses, especially the sensor education and information material, which was developed in the Spring of 2019 by a UALR student, Elizabeth Dourlain.</p>

<p>The Cheminformatics Course is an intercollegiate course hosted within the LibreText HyperLibrary and run on 5 campuses in the Fall of 2019, and has modules in R and Python that could be of value to people interested in IOT.  Please note all the material within the LibreText HyperLibrary is OER.</p>
